Wikipedia says my formula isn't wrong:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM
"With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100 MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600 MB/s."
=> Factor for dual rate is already in the MHz (but I assumed that - vendors bend the truth where they can).

DDR4-3200 is 25600 MB/s according to Wikipedia.

=> //Ok, assuming that N100 also has DDR4-3200 (some pictures mention it), we may still get around one token per second with 69 GB of data. -> Nope.
=> We are splitting by layer, so only one CPU will be working at a time and we will get the memory bandwidth of that single CPU.
=> Thus, 3 sec per token, which is not so great.

This one has 2 LAN ports and DDR5-4800:
